		<p>The four values for overflow, include visible, which basically means if you've drawn a box. And there's a whole bunch of text inside of it, the text is actually gonna go outside the box. So no matter what, the content is visible even if it goes outside the lines. Hidden does pretty much the opposite. It says, [SOUND] if you have something inside this box and it's too big, it's gone. You can't see it. Now this isn't a great idea, because it's going to cause problems if the user increases the font size on their browser. So if you've made some sort of 600 by 800 pixel box, and you think, oh this'll be great, no problem. Anyone will be able to read this. What's going to happen if someone goes in and increases the font size? Your box doesn't get any bigger, but the text does, so they might not be able to see the content. So a third option is to give overflow scroll. And what this will do is it will actually give a horizontal and vertical scrollbar to the element. Even if it's just a paragraph, all of a sudden your paragraph has a scrollbar so people can see everything that's in it. The final value is auto, and what it does is it says, oh, I'm only gonna add scrollbars as needed. Depending on how the person's viewing the site right now. I'm going to go ahead and list some resources to show you some examples of how overflow looks. But for right now, we're going to go ahead and keep moving on.</p>
		<p>Again browsers are always changing. HTML5 and future versions are always changing and they're trying to add new support. The problem is when you see these new cool tools they don't always work on every browser. So inline, inline block, block and none will work everywhere. But here are a few more that are slowly beginning to gain acceptance. And those are table, grid and flexbox. For grid and flexbox, I'm going to leave it to you to kind of play with it. But I did want to show you an example of where a lot of my students find the table display really helpful.
		</p>
		<p>How a table display works is that you don't make an actual table with your HTML code, nor do you have the tag table. But you're telling your browser that you wanna structure it as if it is a table. So, you would make any type of containing element display:table. And then anything that you want to line up in nice columns, you would use display:table-cell. So this sounds very confusing so I wanted to make sure I gave you an example to go through with me.
